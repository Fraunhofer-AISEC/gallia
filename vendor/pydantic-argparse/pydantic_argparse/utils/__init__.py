"""Utilities for Declarative Typed Argument Parsing.

This package contains helper utility functions for the typed argument parsing
process, including formatting argument names and descriptions, formatting
errors, recursively parsing `argparse.Namespace` objects to `dict`s,
interacting with the internals of `pydantic` and determining the types of
`pydantic` fields.

The public interface exposed by this package is the various described utility
modules each containing helper functions.
